# Medical Image Computation, Analysis, and Learning (MICAL)

I plan to build a curated list of deep learning papers (and sourcecode) published in the field of medical image computation, analysis, and learning.

## Background

## Table of Topics
* [Brain Image Segmentation](#brain--image--segmentation)

### Brain Image Segmentation
- **M3Net: A multi-model, multi-size, and multi-view deep neural network for brain magnetic resonance image segmentation** (2019), Jie Wei, and Yong Xia*. [[pdf]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2019.03.004)
